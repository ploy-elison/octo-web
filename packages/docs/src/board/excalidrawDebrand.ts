/**
 * Runtime de-brand of the Excalidraw surfaces that have NO public i18n / composition seam in
 * @excalidraw/excalidraw 0.18.1:
 *
 *   - the four upstream brand link buttons at the top of the Help dialog — Documentation / Blog /
 *     GitHub issues / YouTube (XIN-531 item 2), and
 *   - the "更多工具 → Mermaid 至 Excalidraw" dropdown item (`toolBar.mermaidToExcalidraw`), and
 *   - the Mermaid dialog title + description (`mermaid.title` / `mermaid.description`) (items 3 & 4), and
 *   - the "浏览素材库 / Browse libraries" online entry in the library panel (XIN-557).
 *
 * Why not i18n override: 0.18.1 exposes no way to override individual translations. `t()` reads a
 * module-private `currentLangData`, and there is no `langData` prop or setter on the public API.
 * The mermaid menu item is rendered inside Excalidraw's own shapes toolbar and the mermaid dialog
 * is a built-in modal, so neither is reachable via props/children the way the main menu (item 1,
 * custom `<MainMenu>`) is. Patching the vendored source is explicitly out of scope. So for these
 * surfaces we act on the rendered DOM in place: a subtree MutationObserver watches for the specific
 * nodes and rewrites the upstream brand token to the product word "画布" (mermaid), hides the
 * brand-button header (help dialog), or removes the node (online browse anchor) as they appear.
 *
 * Why the help-dialog header moved here from scoped CSS: item 2 was first hidden with
 * `.excalidraw .HelpDialog__header { display: none }` in board.css. That FAILED on the real machine
 * (XIN-556). The class name is correct — 0.18.1 does render exactly those four `.HelpDialog__btn`
 * anchors inside `.HelpDialog__header` — but Excalidraw's own `.excalidraw .HelpDialog__header
 * { display: flex }` has the SAME specificity, and its `index.css` is pulled in via a dynamic
 * `import()` (BoardShell) that appends to <head> AFTER the statically-imported board.css. On a
 * specificity tie the later stylesheet wins, so `flex` beat `hidden`. Setting `display: none` as an
 * inline style on the node sidesteps the cascade entirely and is verifiable in a jsdom test (a CSS
 * cascade is not), so the observer is the reliable mechanism; board.css keeps a higher-specificity
 * rule only as a no-flash first paint layer.
 *
 * The library browse entry is the same story: `LibraryMenuControlButtons` unconditionally renders
 * `LibraryMenuBrowseButton` — an `<a class="library-menu-browse-button">` whose `href` points at
 * `VITE_APP_LIBRARY_URL` (excalidraw.com's hosted library) and opens `target="_excalidraw_libraries"`.
 * There is no prop to suppress it, so we strip the anchor at runtime with the same observer. The
 * LOCAL library controls are untouched: the "..." dropdown (load/import `.excalidrawlib`,
 * save-to-file/export, reset) and the add-selection-to-library button are siblings/children of that
 * anchor, and the saved-item grid (click/drag-out reuse) lives elsewhere in the panel.
 *
 * The mermaid rewrite is text-only and idempotent: only bare "Excalidraw" tokens inside the three
 * mermaid-specific containers are swapped, element structure (e.g. the description's flowchart /
 * sequence / class highlight links) is preserved, and a node with no remaining token is left
 * untouched — so re-processing the same node, or observing the mutations this makes, never
 * compounds. Hiding the help header is likewise idempotent (inline `display: none` re-applied only
 * when unset) and node-preserving — we never remove the node, so Excalidraw's React tree can still
 * unmount the dialog cleanly. The anchor removal is a no-op once the anchor is gone.
