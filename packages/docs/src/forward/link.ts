// Build the shareable link embedded in a forwarded doc message (feature #511, §1.2).
//
// The link points at the STANDALONE doc page `${origin}/d/:docId` (XIN-450, boss decision
// 2026-07-06), NOT the in-shell `/docs?...&doc=` route. This is the real fix for problem 2: the
// octo host's self-built RouteManager (dmworkbase Service/Route.tsx) handles `pageshow`/`popstate`
// by re-pushing `window.location.pathname` ONLY — it UNCONDITIONALLY strips the query — so a
// `?doc=` deep-link was wiped before the docs module mounted and the recipient landed on the empty
// document list / a login detour. By carrying the docId in the PATH, which the pathname-only
// re-push PRESERVES, the shared link opens the target document directly: apps/web Layout intercepts
// the whole `/d` namespace before the app shell and mounts StandaloneDocPage (which reads the id
// from the path, runs a GET /docs/{docId} preflight, then mounts the collaborative editor). When
// the recipient must sign in first, the anonymous Layout branch stashes the exact `/d/:docId`
// target in sessionStorage (`octo.docs.standaloneReturn`) and the post-login flow bounces them back
// to it — so deep-link direct-open AND login-return both land on the correct document.
//
// We build against window.location.origin the same way invite links are built
// (invite/api.ts buildInviteUrl), so the link is absolute and clickable in chat.
//
// No `?sid=` on the link (XIN-513, boss decision + real-device evidence 2026-07-07): the app stores
// the auth token per space, keyed by `token<sid>`, but the link no longer needs to carry that key.
// An already-logged-in recipient's session is recovered from storage independently of the URL —
// apps/web Layout runs recoverOctoSessionFromStorage on the `/d` path, which (via recoverSession.ts
// findStoredSessions) scans every `token<sid>` bucket in localStorage and adopts a valid stored
// session, so a sid-less link opens the document directly without a login detour. The earlier note
// that a sid-less link bounced a signed-in user to /login described the pre-recovery state and no
// longer holds. Two edge cases stay tracked separately and are out of scope here: a multi-session /
// multi-space user's sid-less recovery may adopt the wrong space session (octo-web #551), and the
// unauthenticated login-return to `/d/:docId` (octo-web #552). The `token<sid>` bucket / recoverSession
// logic itself is untouched — only the minted link stops carrying `?sid`.

 * the docs backend matches in requireDocRole's cross-space guard. XIN-497 reused `?sid` as the
 * preflight space, but a token-bucket sid never equals the doc's space_id, so the preflight 404'd
 * for every recipient (including the owner's own doc). Carrying the real space on its own `?sp` param
 * fixes that without touching the `token<sid>` logic. The receiver opens it → Layout intercepts the
 * `/d` namespace → the stored session is recovered → preflight against `?sp` → StandaloneDocPage
 * mounts the editor (reader / writer / forbidden-with-request / not-found / archived), all outside the
 * app shell and immune to the host's query-wiping re-push (the docId lives in the path, not the query).
